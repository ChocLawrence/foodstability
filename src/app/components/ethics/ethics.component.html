                relevance requirements.</p>

            <p>By submitting or reviewing a manuscript to this journal, your name, email address, and affiliation,
                and other contact details of the publication will be used for the regular operations of the
                publication. The publication and the publisher recognize the importance of protecting the personal
                data collected from stakeholders in the operation of these services, and have practices elaborated

                provide a copy of the consent form to the publisher; however, they should add these informations in
                the cover letter during the submission. </p>
